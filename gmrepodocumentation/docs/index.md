## Aims and features of <b><span style="color:darkblue">G</span><span style="color:red">M</span><span style="color:forestgreen">repo</span></b>

### Capture the full dynamics of human gut microbes

With <b><span style="color:darkblue">G</span><span style="color:red">M</span><span style="color:forestgreen">repo</span></b>,
we aim to capture the full dynamics of the microbes living in the human gut, including their

* abundances and prevalence,
* associations with [human health and diseases :octicons-link-16:](https://gmrepo.humangut.info/phenotypes) , and
* co-occurrences,

all of which can be further stratified by using manually curated meta-data:

* population (country),
* gender,
* age,
* body mass index, and
* many other available meta data.

### Emphasize on data quality and re-usability

With <b><span style="color:darkblue">G</span><span style="color:red">M</span><span style="color:forestgreen">repo</span></b>,
we emphasize on **data quality** and **re-usability** (i.e., availability of the host meta-data).
We thus:

* manually extracted and curated relevant meta-data (most of the time with difficulties) from public databases and related publications;
* consistently re-annotated all data using state-of-the-art methods (see the [Materials and methods :octicons-link-16:](materialsandmethods/dataprocessingandqc.md) page for details);
* applied vigorous quality control (QC) methods and stringent criteria to the data, in order to include only high quality data, but nonetheless kept the meta-data of the samples and runs in our database.

### Make relevant information easier to find

In order to further facilitate users to find data of interests, we equipped <b><span style="color:darkblue">G</span><span style="color:red">M</span><span style="color:forestgreen">repo</span></b> with
[a graphical query builder (data selector) :octicons-link-16:](https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home) to help users to create complex and flexible queries with a few clicks. So far the data selector allows users to filter samples and runs by related technical meta data such as <code>experiment type (16S or Metagenomics)</code>, <code>number of sequenced reads</code>, and host- related meta data, including related phenotype (<code>disease or health</code>), <code>age</code>, <code>sex</code>, and <code>BMI (body mass index)</code>. More filters will be added in the future.
For example, the screenshot below allows users to search for samples (runs) that:

* were taken from healthy individuals with BMI (body mass index) over 25, <code>AND</code>
* were sequenced by either 16S <code>OR</code> metagenomics.
