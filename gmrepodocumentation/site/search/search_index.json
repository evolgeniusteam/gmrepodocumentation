Emphasize on data quality and re-usability \u00b6 With G M repo , we emphasize on data quality and re-usability (i.e., availability of the host meta-data). We thus: manually extracted and curated relevant meta-data (most of the time with difficulties) from public databases and related publications; consistently re-annotated all data using state-of-the-art methods (see the Materials and methods page for details); applied vigorous quality control (QC) methods and stringent criteria to the data, in order to include only high quality data, but nonetheless kept the meta-data of the samples and runs in our database. Make relevant information easier to find \u00b6 In order to further facilitate users to find data of interests, we equipped G M repo with a graphical query builder (data selector) to help users to create complex and flexible queries with a few clicks. So far the data selector allows users to filter samples and runs by related technical meta data such as experiment type (16S or Metagenomics) , number of sequenced reads , and host- related meta data, including related phenotype ( disease or health ), age , sex , and BMI (body mass index) . More filters will be added in the future. For example, the screenshot below allows users to search for samples (runs) that: were taken from healthy individuals with BMI (body mass index) over 25, AND were sequenced by either 16S OR metagenomics.

Seqtk was used to convert sequences from FASTQ to FASTA. Quality control \u00b6 Two rounds of quality control procedures were applied. First, for the 16S data, samples (runs) with less than 20,000 clean reads were removed from subsequent analysis, and marked as \"failed QC (QC status == 0)\" in G M repo .

Two taxa (i.e., either two species or genera) will be considered as co-occurred in a disease (e.g., Crohn Disease) associated samples if they meet all the following criteria: a Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the odds of the two taxa to co-occur in the disease associated samples/runs based on their presence/absence information. A taxon was considered as present in a sample/run if its relative abundance was higher than 0.01%. A p-value and odds ratio (OR) were reported for each pair. The pair with p-value < 0.05 was selected. The fisher.test() function implemented in R was used.

Overview \u00b6 Marker identification was performed for selected projects referred as curated projects in G M repo . These projects were selected based on the following criteria (of course in addition to availability of manpower and time): high-quality meta-data with clearly defined diseases and healthy controls, high-quality of data, and enough numbers of both cases and controls, usually more than 20 per group. Marker taxa \u00b6 A marker taxon refers to a genus or species that showed significantly differential abundances between two different groups (e.g., cases vs. controls or different disease stages such as adenoma vs. CRC) using LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis effect size) PMID: 21702898 . Marker taxa were identified on a per-project basis. Please consult the \"All marker taxa\" page for more information. Curated projects \u00b6 In G M repo , manually curation was performed for selected projects in order to: select usable runs with clearly defined phenotype, merge multiple runs if they correspond to the same sample, and calcualte taxon abundances on per-sample basis instead of per-run basis, group samples according to their corresponding phenotypes, and identify marker taxa between a pair of phenotypes of intersts, e.g. CRC vs. Health. Curated projects are highlighted with a symbol. In addition to the project meta data and run table, the project page for curated projects also contains a list of samples manually curated, their phenotypes and corresponding runs. Followed by marker taxa identified from pairs of phenotypes (refers to as phenotype comparisons in our database). Marker taxa are shown in both table view and boxplot view. If a curated project contains more than two phenotype groups, for example, Healthy controls, Adenoma and colorectal cancer (CRC) multiple phenotype comparisons can be performed, such as Healthy control vs. CRC, Healthy control vs. Adenoma, and Adenoma vs. CRC in order to identify marker taxa for different disease stages.

Here we use two examples to explain what the above purposes mean. 1. Fusobacterium nucleatum \u00b6 F. nucleatum is a known marker for colorectal cancer (CRC). In G M repo , we show that it is also a marker for multiple diseases, including: Crohn Disease, COVID-19, Cardiovascular Diseases, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, and Liver Cirrhosis In addition, it shows consistent trends as a disease-enriched marker: not only across all above diseases, but also across multiple projects of the same diseases, including Crohn Diseases, and Colorectal Neoplasms (CRC). 2. Prevotella copri \u00b6 P. copri is also a marker species for multiple diseases: However, it shows inconsistent trends not only in different diseases (e.g., enriched in Adenoma but depleted in Crohn Diseases ), but also in different projects in the same disease (e.g., in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Colorectal Neoplasms ). Marker taxa of a disease across multiple projects \u00b6 In G M repo , a disease could be covered by multiple datasets/projects. To facilitate cross-project comparisons of the identified markers within each project, a dedicated page for each phenotype pair (e.g., health versus liver cirrhosis, or adenoma versus colorectal cancer) is available to systematically show the consistent and non-consistent disease-associated microbial markers across datasets. Users can check the Phenotype comparisons page for all available phenotype pairs . Below we will use two example to show consistent and inconsistent disease markers across projects. 1. Colorectal Newplasms (CRC) \u00b6 In addition to details of the related projects and a data table of identified marker taxon for CRC (as compared with healthy controls), a tile view is used to visualize all markers stratified by projects: Shown here are microbial markers across the seven projects; it is evident that disease-enriched markers are consistent across projects, including known CRC marker species Fusobacterium nucleatum , Parvimonas micra and Gemella morbillorum . 2.

Its main contents is a table that lists statistics of 131 diseases collected in our database, see the screenshot below: In addition to the data table, several control widgets are available on the top of the table (marked by the red box). Users can use them to find information in the table that they are interested in. Widgets to filter the table contents The widgets in the above screenshot are: filter the table using user supplied key words; filter the contents of the table that DO NOT contain the user supplied key words; do filtering; clear searching results and reset the table Click any one of the disease names, users will be redirected to the corresponding page dedicated to disease-gut microbe associations. Gut microbes associated with a specific disease \u00b6 This page is used to decribe in details of gut microbiota data associated with a specific disease. This page typically consists of four sections. Below the Crohn Disease page is used as an example. 1. Overview of Crohn Disease associated gut microbiota data \u00b6 This section first gives a brief description of the disease (or health) according to the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) database, then summarises the: number of related projects; number of total runs in the related projects; number of processed runs, whose raw sequence data have been downloaded, quality checked and analyzed; number of valid runs that passed our quality control procedures . 2. Overview of disease markers \u00b6 This section uses a table to list the numbers of marker taxa identified between: either Crohn Disease and controls, or two stages of Crohn Diseases (if there are any). See the screenshot below: Note 'Control Groups' and 'Health' are two MeSH IDs commonly used to describe control samples. The main difference between the two is that 'Health' refers to individuals who do not have any detectable dieases, while 'Control Groups' refers to those who do not have the disease of interest, for example 'Crohn Disease' in this case. Thus, in this case the 'Control Groups' also refers to the non-'Crohn Disease' group. the 'Nr. marker taxa' column reports the total number of markers at both genus and species levels. If marker taxa have been identified in multiple projects for the same phenotype pair (e.g., Crohn Disease vs. health), the uniuqe number of all the markers will be reported. 3. Four tables list associated species, genera, projects and runs \u00b6 This section contains four tables that list: species that were identified from the valid runs associated with the disease ( Crohn Disease in this example), and their prevalences and abundances in the valid runs; genera that were identified from the valid runs associated with Crohn Disease , and their prevalences and abundances in the valid runs; related project IDs, descriptions and publications (if there is any); related runs and their QC statuses. Each table is equipped with a set of control widgets allowing users to search the table and filter the rows accordingly. See the screenshot below: 4. a dot plot summarises taxon abundances as a function of prevalence \u00b6 As shown below: Each dot represents a taxon (species or genus). Note Prevalence : proportion of samples in which a species/genus is found above certain abundance threshold (e.g. 0.01%). Abundance : mean/median relative abundance of a species in all samples of a phenotype (e.g., Crohn Disease ). 5. a network plot of co-occurred taxa \u00b6 Below is a screenshot of the network and its control widgets: The four main components of the screenshot a search widget allows uses to find species or genus of interests in the network; it is also a droplist that allows users to select the species/genus in the network.

The links refer to : co-occur relationships between species or genera; the widths are proportional to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient (Pearson correlation), while the colors indicate positive (green) or negative (red) correlations. The co-occurrence between two taxa Two taxa (i.e., either two species or genera) will be considered as co-occurred in the disease ( Crohn Disease ) associated samples if they meet all the following criteria: a Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the odds of the two taxa to co-occur in the disease associated samples/runs based on their presence / absence information. A taxon was considered as present in a sample/run if its relative abundance was higher than 0.01%. A p-value and odds ratio (OR) were reported for each pair. The pair with p-value < 0.05 was selected. The fisher.test() function implemented in R was used. Peasrson correlation analysis was applied to the relative abundances of the two taxa in the disease associated samples. The pair with a p value < 0.05 was selected. Spearman correlation analysis was applied to the relative abundances of the two taxa in the disease associated samples. The pair with a p value < 0.05 was selected. Usage of the network plot mouse over a node to a) highlight the node and its direct neighbors, and b) show the names of the node and its direct neighbors; click a node to highlight it and its direct neighbors click a node and move it around to fade other nodes and edges; click the text label of a node to show the association details in a new window; double-click a node to move it to the canvas center; double-click the canvas to zoom in; use mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the whole plot; use the selector on the top of the plot to find a node of interest and move it to the view center. Association beteen a taxon and a disease \u00b6 This page shows the distributions of a taxon (at species or genus level) in samples associated with a specific disease. Here we use the association between [Ruminococcus] torques and Crohn Disease as an example to explain the contents and organization of this page. This page consists of four secdtions: 1. Overview of the association \u00b6 This part contains: a brief description of this disease in the MeSH database; statistics on associated projects and runs statistics on the prevalence of [Ruminococcus] torques in disease associated samples; This part also contains links to other pages in GMrepo: all dieases associated with the taxon, all gut microbes at species and genus levels associated with Crohn Disease , and links to external databases, including: NCBI taxonomic database , and MVP database for phage and bacterium associations (if there is any). 2. graphical representation of the association \u00b6 This part includes two plots, a histogram and a box plot showing the distribution of the relative abundances across Crohn Disease associated samples. Tip For comparison, the abundance distributions of the taxon ( [Ruminococcus] torques ) in all healthy samples will also be displayed. 3. Relative abundance details of this taxon \u00b6 This part contains a list of Crohn Disease associated samples in which [Ruminococcus] torques can be found. As shown below, in addition to the relative abundance values of [Ruminococcus] torques , meta-data of the samples are also shown, including age, gender and BMI information of the associated patients.

For example, the first bar in the left panel means that about 66% of all species are found in four or less (0-4) phenotypes . Detailed information on a specific taxon \u00b6 This webpage contains almost all information on a taxon in our database, including: its association with dieases, its prevalence and abundances across diseases, whether it is a marker, in how many diseases it serves as a marker and its trends (i.e., enrichment and depletion) in diseases and healthy controls. Here we use Fusobacterium nucleatum as an example to show the contents of this page. 1. Overview \u00b6 This part summarises very briefly the number of runs in which Fusobacterium nucleatum can be found, and the number phenotypes (diseases and health) it associated with. It also includes links to external databases, including NCBI taxonomic database , and MVP database for phage and bacterium associations (if there is any). 2. Stats on associated phenotypes \u00b6 This part contains a table and a barplot. The table lists the associated diseases and the prevalence of Fusobacterium nucleatum in the corresponding disease-associated samples. Users can click a disease name, e.g., Crohn Disease to view more information on gut microbes associated with the disease in our database . The barplot shows basically the same statistics: Tip By default, phenotypes with more than 50 valid runs will be included in this barplot. Users may increase/decrease this threshold using widgets above. Here prevalence is defined as percentage of runs in which current taxon is present (w/ relative abundance >= 0.01%) out of valid runs. 3. Relative abundances of the taxon in different diseases and healthy samples \u00b6 The relative abundances of the taxon across diseases and health are shown in: a density plot, and a boxplot. See here for an example . 4. Marker taxon \u00b6 Please consult the marker identification documentation for more details on how markers are identified . Note The markers are identified on per-project basis, and between either a disease and health (e.g., colorectal cancer (CRC) vs. healthy controls), or different stages of the same disease (e.g., CRC and adenoma). In G M repo , marker information in this microbe-centric page are presented using a table and a barplot. As shown below is the barplot view of Fusobacterium nucleatum as a marker taxon : Note From this plot we can see that F. nucleatum has been identified as a marker in many diseases; It shows consistent enrichment in diseases as compared with healthy controls, and in more advanced disease stages (e.g., adenoma vs. CRC); It also shows consistent trend in multiple projects related to the same disease (e.g., Colorectal Neoplasms (CRC)).","title":"Microbe centric pages"},{"location":"websiteandUI/microbecentricpages/#gut-microbe-centric-pages","text":"Similar to disease centric pages , there are two types of gut microbe centric webpages , i.e., the information are organized around the microbe(s), including: the gut microbes page that lists all gut microbes identified in the qualified samples collected in G M repo , the single taxon page that lists its associated diseases and distributions across diseases.

There are four types of webpages for projects and runs . All projects and runs \u00b6 This page provides statistics on the data collected in G M repo , and lists all projects and runs in two tables, from the tables users can access webpages for details of a specific project or run. It thus consists three parts: 1. Overview \u00b6 This parts provides overview of data collected in our database. For example, the current release contains: Meta data for in total 71,642 runs (samples), belonging to 353 projects. Among which, raw data have been processed for in total 53,700 runs (samples), belonging to 282 projects. Among which, microbe abundance data are available for in total 37,550 runs (samples), belonging to 209 projects. In total 16,150 runs (samples), belonging to 159 projects failed our QC processes. In addition, G M repo also includes information on 76 projects whose raw data were not processed, including in total 31,381 runs/samples, due to various reasons, mostly the lack of a clearly defined health/disease information. 2. All projects table \u00b6 This table contains a list of collected projects, their associated diseases, related publications, brief descriptions and whether the rawdata have been processed. The rawdata of a project will not be processed if it lacks certain essential meta-data. For example, G M repo currently contains 76 projects whose raw data were not processed, correspondin to in total 31,381 runs/samples, due to various reasons, mostly because of the lack of phenotype information; uses can click the project id for details. For example, project PRJNA682076 contains 666 samples/runs; it was not processed because host-related information were not available, including the disease/heath information, age, gender and BMI . 3. All runs table \u00b6 This table contains a list of collected samples in G M repo . Also available are meta-data including: technical meta-data such as: experiment type (16S or Metagenomics), sequencing devices / instruments, and number of obtained sequencing reads. Host-related, biological-relevant meta-data such as: disease or health of the host (refered as to phenotype in our database), age, sex, BMI (body mass index), and antibiotic usage. Meta data are available for in total 71,642 runs/samples. A QCStatus (quanlity-control result) is available for each run, which can be one of the three values: 1: the data passed our QC procedure and the processed results (i.e., taxnomic assignments) have been loaded into our database, 0: the data did NOT pass our QC, (empty): data yet to be proccessed and loaded to our database. Please consult Data processing & QC for more details. project details page \u00b6 The project details page is available for each collected project in G M repo , and provides details on a project, including: included samples, associated disease(s), related publication(s), and disease marker analysis results Here are some random examples: PRJEB1220 PRJEB6337 PRJEB6070 1. Project overview \u00b6 This part provides some basic information regarding a project, including: a brief project description obtained from public databases, mostly from ENA (European Nucleotide Archive) or NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive) database , number of included runs, related publication(s), if available, whether the project is a curated project . 2. Included runs/samples \u00b6 This part includes a table that contains a list of runs/samples included in the project. Similar to the All runs table , related technical and biological meta-data and QCStatus are also listed in the table. Please consult the All runs table section above for more details. 3. In-depth analysis \u00b6 In-depth analysis so far includes only marker identification . Please consult our documentation on Disease marker identification for more details. Briefly, microbial markers that show significantly differential abundances between: either a disease and the healthy control group, e.g., CRC and health, or two distinct stages of a disease, e.g., adenoma and CRC are identified using LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis effect size) PMID: 21702898 . In G M repo , markers are identified on per-project basis, thus the analysis results are included in this project details for each project. In addition to be shown in a data table, the LEfSe results are also visualized in a barplot, as shown below: this plot shows marker species that show |LDA score| >= 2.0 between CRC and healthy controls in project PRJDB4176 , in which green (pink) bars indicate health(CRC)-enriched species. Note for whole-genome shortgun sequencing (a.k.a mNGS) projects, markers were identified at both species and genus levels; for 16S amplicon data (a.k.a 16S) projects, markers were identified at only genus . users can choose to show either species or genus level markers, or both, by using the control buttons above the barplot. Run details page \u00b6 This page shows details of a specific run, and includes two parts. 1. Run details and meta-data \u00b6 This part includes: run ID, a brief introduction, related project ID and sample ID, associated disease, and meta-data 2. Taxonomic profile \u00b6 This part shows the taxonomic profile, i.e., the bacterial species/genus identified in the run and their relative abundances. See ERR481097 for an example.
